# QuantumComputing
Lousy mini-library for basic quantum algorithms

Library is in a very basic state, but is capable of implementing basic quantum circuits, like this one:

Code implementing this circuit is in the Example.py file

Also, repo contains implementations of Deutsch's algorithm and the quantum teleportation algorithm (ignore the BB84 pls, it's copypaste from a book).
